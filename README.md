## Long-read-based single sperm genome sequencing for variant calling and chromosome-wide haplotype phasing

Since the next generation genome sequencing technology on single gametes was demonstrated, continuous improvements of single-gamete whole-genome sequencing technologies were used to advance the study of sperm. However, they rely on short-read sequencing, limiting their ability to study more genome diversity and instability in sperm. To address these limitations, we developed a long read based single-sperm sequencing method. Benefitting from long-read sequencing, our method can not only identify crossover events and chromosomal aneuploidies in single sperm, but also efficiently detect structural variations (SVs) of a single sperm, including the SVs containing complex repetitive sequences, opening up the future studies of SV regulation and function in evolution, infertility and genetic diseases. In addition, even without parental information, our method could accurately phased the HetSVs from fertile offspring within chromosome-wide, and the phasing accuracy is up to 98%. Besides, the repeat expansions of haplotype-resolved STRs/VNTRs in single-sperm could also be estimated. Our method provides a new perspective for the study of haploid genetics.
